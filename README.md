# Twitter Bot Project

This project is a simple Twitter bot that interacts with users by liking tweets and searching for specific keywords. The bot automates basic interactions, helping to engage with the Twitter community programmatically.

## Project Overview

The bot uses the **Twitter API** to search for tweets containing specific keywords and automatically likes them. It's a starting point for building more complex interactions, such as retweeting or replying to tweets. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to automate Twitter tasks using Python and the **Tweepy** library.

### Key Features:
- Search for tweets based on specific keywords.
- Automatically like tweets that match the search criteria.
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase for expanding functionality.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for the bot.
- **Tweepy**: A Python library for interacting with the Twitter API.
- **Twitter API**: Used to access and interact with Twitter data.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/twitter-bot.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up Twitter API keys:
   - Create a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/) if you don't have one.
   - Create a new app and get the following keys:
           - API Key
           - API Secret Key
           - Access Token
           - Access Token Secret
4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Twitter API credentials:
   ```bash
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   API_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret_key
   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
5. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
## Customization
- You can modify the search criteria by adjusting the keywords in the bot.py file:
  ```bash
  search_query = 'Python'
- Feel free to add more features such as:
   Auto-replies.
   Retweeting.
   Following users.
## Limitations
- This project uses free access to the Twitter API, which comes with certain limitations, such as a cap on the number of searches and likes per day.
## Future Improvements
- Expand functionality to include tweet replies and retweets.
- Add logging to track the bot's activity.
- Integrate more sophisticated search patterns.
- I'm still working on the project and there's a lot to be done.
